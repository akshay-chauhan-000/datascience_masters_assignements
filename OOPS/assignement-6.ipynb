    "1. **Encapsulation:** It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class. It helps in controlling the accessibility and visibility of the data.\n",

    "2. **Inheritance:** It is a mechanism where a class can inherit attributes and behaviors from another class. It allows the creation of a new class based on an existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism:** It means having multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects to behave differently based on their data types or classes. It allows a single function or method to work with different types of input.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Abstraction:** It involves hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the relevant features or functionalities. It allows the user to interact with the object without needing to know how it's implemented internally."
